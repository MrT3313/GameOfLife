# Conway's Game of Life

"The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a `cellular automation` devised by the British matnematicial John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a `zero-player game`, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is `Turing complete` and can simulata a universal constructor or any other Turing machine."

# Game Rules
- "Populated" Cell:  

    1. Each cell with <= 1 neighbor DIES
    2. Each cell with >= 4 neighbors DIES 
    3. Each cell with >= 2 & <= 3 neighbors SURVIVES

- "Empty" Cell:

    1. A cell with 3 neighbors BECOMES POPULATED

| Cellular Automation | A cellular automaton is a collection of "colored" cells on a grid of specified shape that evolves through a number of discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells        | [Link](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html)    |
|  Turing Complete    |  A system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. This means that this system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets.   | [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)               |
